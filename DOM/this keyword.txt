this keyword in JS

In JS, this keyword refers to the current context

this object - always refers to a single object and it is usually used
inside a function or a method to access properties and methods which
are a part of the object which is associated with the function.



E.g.,
var first = 'rose';
var person={
        first:'jack';
        getname:function(){
                console.log(first);
        }
}


Here console prints rose 
if instead first, there is this.first, then the console prints jack
